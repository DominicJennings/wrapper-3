# Wrapper 3
Wrapper 3 is a clone of LinuxAnimate except it works on windows. THis is also requested by MKAnimates.

## Limitations in the stable release.
You cannot create your own characters besides uploading and deleting them. i know that this may sound curel to some. but if you want the ability to create characters, you must get Wrapper 3 either from the goproduction channel or dev channel (dev channel is not recomended as it may be unstable) However, when you first get Wrapper 3 from this channel, there will be some characters featured in the custom characters slot to start you off with making videos in windows. if you don't like some of those characters, then please click on the delete icon on the characters list and it will then be gone from the list in one click. if you like some of these characters, then please feel free to download them to use in wrapper offline. If you are a goanimator, then it is recommended that you get Wrapper 3 from the goproduction channel as it is alot more usable there.
You also cannot save starters in wrapper 3 using this channel. i would say that there is no way to use the starters in the studio at all besides uploading them here for safekeeping.

## Limitations in other releases.
