# LinuxAnimate
LinuxAnimate is like wrapper offline but it only works on linux and every linux distro including chromeos linux. Some features here are just about the same as wrapper offline. and this time, there are four channels on where you can get this lvm project from, they all include, the dev version (unstable) the beta version (not recomended) the goproduction version (lvm ment for goanimators) and the stable channel (for a first time goanimate user). Please have fun using LinuxAnimate on your linux machine!

## Limitations in the stable release.
You cannot create your own characters besides uploading and deleting them. i know that this may sound curel to some. but if you want the ability to create characters, you must get LinuxAnimate either from the goproduction channel or dev channel (dev channel is not recomended as it may be unstable) However, when you first get LinuxAnimate from this channel, there will be some characters featured in the custom characters slot to start you off with making videos in your linux machine/chromeos. if you don't like some of those characters, then please click on the delete icon on the characters list and it will then be gone from the list in one click. if you like some of these characters, then please feel free to download them to use in wrapper offline. If you are a goanimator, then it is recommended that you get LinuxAnimate from the goproduction channel as it is alot more usable there.
You also cannot save starters in linuxanimate using this channel. i would say that there is no way to use the starters in the studio at all besides uploading them here for safekeeping.

## Limitations in other releases.
